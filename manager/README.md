# Configuration

You can change the default app configuration (provided in manager/configs.)
- `MANAGER_SERVER_HOST` - host to bind
- `MANAGER_SERVER_PORT` - port to bind
- `MANAGER_WORKERS_LIST` - list of workers. Each worker is configured by 2 values: `host:port`. 2 workers are separated from each other with **':'**
